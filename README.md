# RoadGuard

RoadGuard is a mobile application for drivers that allows users to see other drivers on the road, their behavior ratings, and receive real-time warnings about dangerous drivers. The goal is to improve road safety and promote social interaction among drivers.

## Features

- **Live Driver Map**: See yourself and other users on the map with color-coded icons representing driver ratings:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Calm / Safe
  - ðŸŸ¡ Neutral / Average
  - ðŸ”´ Aggressive / Dangerous
- **Driver Ratings**: Like/dislike other drivers and calculate average ratings. Reputation system prevents abuse.
- **Anonymous Reports**: Report unsafe drivers, including non-registered users, showing temporary danger zones on the map.
- **Vehicle Info**: Optional display of car make and color in user profiles; supports anonymous mode.
- **Privacy & Security**: No license plates, VINs, or personal data stored. Real-time location only; history is not saved.
- **Gamification**: User levels and achievements based on ratings and reputation.
